/*
 Observer design pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to get notified whenever there is any change. In observer pattern, the object that watch on the state of another object are called Observer and the object that is being watched is called Subject. According to GoF, observer pattern intent is;

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Subject contains a list of observers to notify of any change in it�s state, so it should provide methods using which observers can register and unregister themselves. Subject also contain a method to notify all the observers of any change and either it can send the update while notifying the observer or it can provide another method to get the update.

Observer should have a method to set the object to watch and another method that will be used by Subject to notify them of any updates.

/*
 Java provides inbuilt platform for implementing Observer pattern through java.util.Observable class and java.util.Observer interface. However it�s not widely used because the implementation is really simple and most of the times we don�t want to end up extending a class just for implementing Observer pattern as java doesn�t provide multiple inheritance in classes.

Java Message Service (JMS) uses Observer pattern along with Mediator pattern to allow applications to subscribe and publish data to other applications.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) frameworks also use Observer pattern where Model is the Subject and Views are observers that can register to get notified of any change to the model.

Observer Pattern Example

For our example, we would implement a simple topic and observers can register to this topic. Whenever any new message will be posted to the topic, all the registers observers will be notified and they can consume the message.

Based on the requirements of Subject, here is the base Subject interface that defines the contract methods to be implemented by any concrete subject.

public interface Subject {
	 
    //methods to register and unregister observers
    public void register(Observer obj);
    public void unregister(Observer obj);
     
    //method to notify observers of change
    public void notifyObservers();
     
    //method to get updates from subject
    public Object getUpdate(Observer obj);
     
}
